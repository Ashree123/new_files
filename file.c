Hello !
Tanishka Bhardwaj this side. 
I'm really glad to meet you.
It's an honour to have you in front of me.
I've been waiting for this day since my childhood.
You are my idol,my inspiration as well as my role model.
I want to become just like you.
I don't know why but this feeling arose when I first saw you with my quite childish
but maturity filled eyes.
But this is a fact that I can't become exactly like you in my life.
I love you to the moon and back.
Lucky are those who have mothers but,
